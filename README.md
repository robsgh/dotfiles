# Rob's Dotfiles

## A very custom script to carry my configs around

Configurations for:

* alacritty -> HW Accelerated terminal emulator
* i3 -> Window Manager of choice
* nvim -> IDE functions and QoL improvements for neovim
* picom -> improvements to the compositor
* polybar -> Fairly basic i3bar that isn't as barebones as the out-of-the-box i3bar
* rofi -> Modern reinterpretation of a dmenu-esque launcher tool


## Usage:

```bash
$ ./dotify.sh
```

and then hope and pray. The script should attempt to bootstrap packer, too. It will not handle installing oh-my-zsh, though (yet?).
