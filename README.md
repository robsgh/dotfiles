# Rob's Dotfiles

## A very custom script to carry my configs around

Configurations for:

* hyprland -> Wayland tiling wm with neat-o animations
* hyprpaper -> Wallpaper manager for hyprland
* waybar -> Wayland-native bar with hyprland integrations
* nvim -> Modified [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) config
* zsh -> self explanatory
* tmux -> Super duper cool status line that isn't green


## Usage:

```bash
$ ./dotify.sh
```

and then hope and pray.
