# Rob's Dotfiles

## A very custom script to carry my configs around

Configurations for:

* alacritty -> HW accelerated terminal emulator
* i3 -> Window manager of choice
* nvim -> Modified [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) config
* picom -> Improvements to the compositor
* polybar -> Fairly basic i3bar that isn't as barebones as the out-of-the-box i3bar
* rofi -> Modern reinterpretation of a dmenu-esque launcher tool
* zsh -> self explanatory
* tmux -> Super duper cool status line that isn't green


## Usage:

```bash
$ ./dotify.sh
```

and then hope and pray. The script should attempt to bootstrap packer, too.
